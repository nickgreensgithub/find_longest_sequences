# Find longest sequences
A simple tool written in c++ for use in [AutoTax](https://github.com/kasperskytte/autotax), it dereplicates and filters sequences in an input fasta file. Sequences are removed if longer sequences are found which are 100% identical, relative order of sequences is maintained.

U and T sequence characters are treated as if they're the same.
## Compilation:
```bash
cmake .
make
```
## Usage: 
```bash
findLongSeqs <input_file> <output_file> <threads>
```
## Dependencies:
- OpenMP

## Example usage
input_file.fa
```bash
>one
GAT
>two
EGACA
>three
GAAB
>four
GAAT
>five
GAATA
>six
GATACR
>seven
EGATA
>eight
EGATA
>nine
GAACA
>ten
EGATA
>eleven
GATU
>twelve
GATT
```
